Nous. 49

”mactari ε the official word of sacrifice, “to slay a victim.”
1t is connected with old verb mayere .· probably '⁴ to strike :”
cp. μάχη, hence ‘f to ki11.’'

§28.-¹candem: cp. note 1, ἕ 1. Cicero shews that neither
precedent, nor laws, nor the judgment of future generations
deter Catiline.

'Act introduces the objection of an opponent :,“ Yes, but.''
Cicero refers here to the case of P. Scipio Nasica who headed
the nobility against Tib. Gracchus.

⁸au loyes ? Principally the leyes Valeriae and leyes Porciae.
The former were proposed by (1) P. Valerius Poplicola 509
B.C. which enacted that no Roman magistrate should put to
death or flog a Roman citizen if he had appealed to the people:
(2) in 449 B.C. L. Valerius Potitus enacted that no magistracy
should be held with an exemption from appeal: (3) in 300 B.C.
M. Valerius Corvus brought in a bill sanctioning the other laws
on the subject of appeal. The leycs Porciae were proposed by
three of the Porcii, and exempted from stripes the persons ol
Roman citizens, and imposed heavy fines on any one who should
scourge or kill a Roman citizen.

⁴r09atae sunt: “have been passed.'' The people at the
comitia were asked to pass a law by the presiding magistrate in
the words “velifis, jubeatis, Quirites.” Hence royare legem,
“to pass a bill.'' When the people voted two ballots were
usually given them, one marked with the letters U R (i.e. uti
royae or “yea”)‚ and the other with A (i.e. antiquo, antiqua
probo, ‘⁸ 1 annul ’').

⁸praeclaram qratiam ε “ a fine return :” strongly ironical.

‘hominem-coynitum ε i.e. hominem novum ε the Romans
applied the term (novus homo) to the first of a family who had
raised himself to a consul office. tam mature ι the lea: annalia
enacted that no one could obtain the quaetorship till he was 31 ;
the aedileehip till 37 ι the praetorship till 41 ; and the consulship
till 43. Cicero means that he obtained these offices as soon as
he was eligible to hold them.

'propter invidiam: “because of too disquieting sear of un·
popularity.''

§29.—¹num-pertime3cenda? “Is the ill-will arising from
a strict and a firm discharge of duty to be seared rather than that
arising from indolence and indifference.’¹
