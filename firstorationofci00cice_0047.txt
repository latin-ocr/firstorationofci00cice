CHAPTER VI.

‘quod—possit: H„ 503, Ι.

'extra—hominum: “ unconnected with that band of conspira-
tors composed of worthless men '’—conjuratiox used in a eon·
crete sense: cp. advocatia servitium. For subjunctive: H..
500, Ι.

Quae-est? “what stain of domestic insamy has not been
branded on your life? ¹' Distinguish: ηόίᾶ, nota, τιόιᾶ. The
expression nota domesticae turpitudinis differs in meaning from
privatarum rerum dedecus: the former relates to moral or
immoral domestic life, the latter to all private actions as op-
posed to those that affect a man’s public character. Nota is
applied (1) to the brand on cattle; Virg. Georg. 3, 158: (2) to
the mark placed on a fugitive slave when retaken: (3) to the
mark placed by the censor (nota cen-soria) on revising the list
of citizens, opposite the name of the person degraded. Accord-

his own son that there might be no obstacle to his marrying

facinus, a bold, dax-ing deed, in a bad sense, unless justified by
some favourable epithet ε flayicium, a disgracesul, lustful excess.

”cui—praetulisti? “to what youth, after you had once en-
tangled him by the allurements os vice, did you not hand either
a dagger to commit some daring deed, or a torch to inflame his
passion?” adulescentulo: the diminutive is used in a depre-
ciatory sense, since many a weak youth was misled by Catiline
(Sallust Cat., c. 14). facem: the figure refers to the nightly
revels and debauches of Catiline. Slaves carried torches before
their masters at night to show the way. The torch of Catiline
not merely showed the way to crimes, but served to inflame the
passions of lust.

§14.—¹qm‘d vero? scil, dicam; “further:” lit. “whau
indeed, shall Ι say?'’

²nuper—cumulasli? '’ When lately by the death of your first
