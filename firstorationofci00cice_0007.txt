PREFACE.

lt nas been the aim of the Editor to explain what
seemed to him difficulties in the text. There are many
points which might have been noted, but which a judi-

cious teacher will supply in the ordinary class work.

References are made to the standard grammars of

Zumpt, Madvig, Harkness, Allen and Greenough.
