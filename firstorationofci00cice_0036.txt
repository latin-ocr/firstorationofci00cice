²in senatum venit: as vir praetorius Catiline had a right to
enter the Senate.

⁸notat et destjgnat .· a metaphor from the marking of the animals
appointed sor sacrifice. Cicero osten uses synonymous words to
impress the idea more strongly: “he marks and stamps each
one of us for slaughter :'' cp. Leg. Man. 3, 7. Cives Romanos
necandos trucidandosque denotavit.

ἓ 3. ¹An vero: the original force os an is “or,' and when
used interrogatively the sentence is elliptical. Here we may
supply: “Am I right in my conjecture, or, in fact, did that
illustr-lons man, P. Scipio, chief pontiff, though filling no
