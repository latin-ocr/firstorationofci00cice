here that Augustus built a splendid mansion : hence our word
palate from the residence of the emperor built on the Palatium.
In times of danger the Palatium, one of the most important
military posts of the city, was occupied by a guard. Originally
the word meant the “feeding place :'' root pal, pascere: cp.
Pales, Palilia. Varro derives it from pal, “to wander :'' cp.
palor. It may have been the ‘⁴ common ’' sor cattle in early
days. ngliae: under the republic, on emergencies, the trium-
viri capitales, aediles or tribuni plebis acting as a kind of police ap·
pointed night watches to keep orden—timor populi .· cp. Sallust.

there as well as from its position.—ora vultusque: the former
denotes the natural and habitual state, as expressed by the
mouth ancl the lower part of the sace ε while the latter indicates
the temporary and changing state, as expressed by the motion
of the eye and brow.

has already come within the privitv of all these ?'’ literally, “is
held bound by. ’' Orelli distinguishes between non and nonne

of his opinion, does not heed the answer of the opponent ·
where nonne is used, the speaker expects and wishes that the

metaphor is taken from chaining a wild beast to which he here
compares the conspiracy.
