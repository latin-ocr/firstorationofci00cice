thum: see Proper Names—mediocriter labefactantemz Cicero
designedly extenuates the guilt of Gracchus to heighten the
crimes of Catiline. In fact, the orator represents the guilt οἱ
Gracchus in different lights according to the exigencies of his
cause: cp. De Leg. Ag.‚ 2, 5, 10: De Off. 11.. 12, 43.
Catilinam: emphatic position: “Catiline, desiring to devas-
tate the world with sword and fire shall we consuls tolerate?”-—
orbis terrae: there is little difference between orbis terrae and
orbis terrarum—caede atque incendia- : also ferro et tgni.

²illa : “the following instance : '’ though only the case ol
Ahala is mentioned, the plural is probably used to intimate that
other cases might be adduced.

⁸C. Servilius Ahala : see Proper Names.

‘novis—studentem: “aiming to overtum the government :’'
cp. νεωτερίζειν.

¹{fuit-fuit : note the emphatic repetition of the word (epizeuxis).
ista virtus: here ista=illa : “that well-known public spiritz ”
We may take virtus :amor patriae: “ patriotism.''

‘ut—coercerent: “that brave men inflicted severer punish·
ment on a sactious citizen then on the bitterest soe ''—suppliciis:

abiiennzgffiseonsultum: the decree arming the consuls with civil

and military power. The formula was videant consules ne quid
respublica detrimenti capiat.

Screlzemens et grave: “ sull of force and severity.''

⁹rei publicae: generally taken as a dative aster deest: others
take it as a genitive depending on consilium, i.e., there is no
lack of precedents of the state, i.e., the state have many in-
stances of wicked citizens being punished. The state, accord-
ing to Cicero, has enough of wisdom (consilium) and determin-
ing authority (auctoritas), but the executive power is weak.

CHAPTER 11.

S 4. ¹quondam: B.C. 121 ι see C. Gracchus, in Proper
Names. In a decree of this kind both consuls were named.
The other, Q. Fabius, was at that time in that part of Gaul
known afterwards as Provincia, and his absence from Rome
may account for the omission os his name from the decree.

²intercessit: i.e., between the passing of the decree and the
death os Gracchus.

⁸progner--saspicianes ε another case of extenuation to bring out
more vividly the guilt of Catiline. Distinguish suspicio, suspmo.
